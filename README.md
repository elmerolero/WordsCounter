# Word Counter in Java

This is a simple word counter project developed in Java for the **Parallel Computing** course. While it does not yet implement real parallelism, it showcases basic file handling and word frequency analysis using standard Java utilities.

## 📄 Description

The program reads a text file and counts the number of times each word appears. It then displays a histogram-like output showing word frequencies. This was a class assignment focused more on demonstrating basic Java skills than on performance or parallelism.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- File I/O in Java
- String manipulation
- HashMap usage for counting
- Basic OOP structure

## 🏗️ How to Run

Make sure you have **Java 8+** and **Maven** installed.

```bash
# Compile the project
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java -cp target/Proyecto-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.proyecto.Main
